# Key Features

## ðŸ”¥ Streaks
**Streaks** are counters you can increase with daily activity on websites. 
For any site, you can choose to start a streak for it by opening the extension and clicking "+ Start a Streak." 
Come back each day to that website to watch your streak grow!

## ðŸ’Ž Gems
**Gems** are a completely free currency that users can gain by increasing their streaks. Streaks will earn users an extra `+1 ðŸ’Ž` for every 10 days the streak has been active.

## GemShop
A small storefront where you can trade **Gems** for unique items, such as **Streak Freezes**, which is a one-time-use streak saver that protects you from one day of not keeping your streak.

The extension uses `background.js` to update the extension's badgeText to reflect the current streak length of the domain

  <i>Active Streak vs No Streak</i>
</p>

## Minimal Data Storage and Easy Removal
- All data is stored using `chrome.storage.local`, and no requests are sent to other servers.
- On making a streak, the only info stored is the current tab's domain (i.e., `www.github.com`)
- Only the following info is ever stored: `{DomainName: [(Int)StreakLength, (Int)MaxStreak, (Int)DayNumberOfLastVisit, (Bool)streakFreezeActive]}`, `(Bool)LightMode`, and `(Int gems)`.
- At any point, the user may delete any and all stored information by clicking the `Clear All` button. This will call `chrome.storage.local.clear()`, wiping everything from storage, ending all streaks, and setting the default view to light mode. Only gems will persist.
```popup.js
    if(deleteAll) {
      chrome.storage.local.clear(function() {
        var error = chrome.runtime.lastError;
        if (error) {console.error(error);} 
        else {
          chrome.storage.local.set({'gems': gemCount}); // Gems persist through deletion
          window.close(); // Close popup
        }
      });
    )
```
## CSP Compliance
- StreakBuilder uses no inline JS or commands, complying with the [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP)

# Permissions Required
## `storage`
- Allows StreakBuilder to locally store streak information with `chrome.storage.local`
- Allows the service worker to access the streak data that popup.js stores
## `tabs` and `activeTab`
- Allows popup.js to identify the domain of the current tab to display on the extension.
- Allows background.js to update the badgeText to reflect the domain's current streak

An excellent [TED Talk presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6FORpg0KVo) from Loui von Ahn, the founder of Duolingo, on the power of streaks for learning and building strong habits.
